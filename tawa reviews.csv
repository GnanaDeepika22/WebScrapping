Bishakha Chowdhury,,Expected a better product,"I am writing this review after 3 day usage. The back coating is coming off little. The non stick coating is also getting off very little from the sides. For the price the quality could have been better. Price and quality should go hand in hand. I do not recommend this tawa for people eating dosa every other day, this tawa will not be able to take sustain its quality over time. It is good for people who eat dosa once in a week or once in two weeks..READ MORE","Certified Buyer, Lumding","Jul, 2021",269,269
